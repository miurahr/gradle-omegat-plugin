The OmegaT gradle plugin allow you to generate translation files from original source text
with TMX translation memory DB.

# Getting Started Using the Plugin

Please follow the below steps to add the Gradle OmegaT Plugin to your Gradle build script.

#### Step 1: Apply the plugin to your Gradle script

To apply the plugin, please add one of the following snippets to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://dl.bintray.com/miurahr/maven/"
        }
        maven {
            url "https://dl.bintray.com/omegat-org/maven/"
        }
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.omegat.gradle:gradle-omegat-plugin:0.9.4'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'com.omegat.gradle'
```
Note:
As in 20, Auguest, 2016, the plugin is located my bintray repository and not in jcenter nor
official plugin repository.

#### Step 2: Add the `omegat` configuration closure to your `build.gradle` file

```groovy
omegat {
    projectDir project.rootDir
}
```

If not specified, the OmegaT plugin assumes project directory `$projectDir` is an omegat project root.

### Step 3: Add your own custom OmegaT task

You can make your own custom task using `OmegatTask` type.
Here is an example to run Java properties alignment from gradle task.

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://dl.bintray.com/miurahr/maven/"
    }
    maven {
        url "https://dl.bintray.com/omegat-org/maven/"
    }
    jcenter()
}
import org.omegat.gradle.OmegatTask

task runOmegaT(type: OmegatTask) {
    options = [projectDir]
}

task alignProperties(type: OmegatTask) {
    options = [projectDir, "--mode=console-align", "--alignDir=/translatedFiles/"]
}
```

### Step 4: Call translation

```bash
$ ./gradlew translate
```

This will generate translation result in OmegaT target directory.


### Step 5: Clean targets

```bash
$ ./gradlew cleanTranslation
```

Also edit `src/main/resources/org/omegat/gradle/omegat.properties` for
dependency versions. This text is used both Gradle build script and
plugin source.

### Test artifact

Run
```
$ ./gradlew uploadArchives
```
then gradle installes artifact into your local maven repository.
This effects your development environment to support new test version
is accesible from your test project.

### Upload artifact

After you satisfy test result, you can upload the artifact onto bintray
maven repository.
```
$ ./graldew bintrayUpload
```
